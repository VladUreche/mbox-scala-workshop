\section{Benchmarks}

In order to prove the efficiency of the miniboxing plugin, we wrote a benchmark about a common numerical application: the \textit{least squares method}. This method finds the best-fitting curve to a given set of points. Since it deals with numbers, type erasure would induce boxing and unboxing. The method should therefore run faster with the miniboxing plugin. The benchmark used is the following:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
 // returns a random value between (-1,1)
 val random = new scala.util.Random(0)
 def rand = random.nextDouble - random.nextDouble
 
 val slope = 3.0  // arbitrary
 val intercept = 1.0  // arbitrary
 // func(x) = 3x + 1
 val func = new Function1[Int, Double] {
   def apply(x: Int): Double =
      slope*x + intercept
 }
 
 val size = 10000 // amount of points
 var xs: List[Double] = Nil // list of x-coord.
 var ys: List[Double] = Nil // list of y-coord.
 
 // fills xs/ys with function + noise
 var i = 0
 while (i < size) {
  xs = (i + rand) :: xs
  ys = (func(i) + rand) :: ys
  i += 1
 }
 
 val xy = xs.zip(ys) // list of (x,y) coord.
 
  // function (x, y) => x * y
 val fxy =
  new Function1[Tuple2[Double,Double], Double] {
     def apply(t: Tuple2[Double, Double]): Double = t._1 * t._2
 }
 
 // function x => x * x
 val fxx = new Function1[Double, Double] {
   def apply(x: Double): Double = x * x
 }
 
 val sumx  = xs.sum
 val sumy  = ys.sum
 val sumxy = listxy.map(fxy).sum
 val squarex = listx.map(fxx).sum
 
 // slope and intercept approximation
 val m = (size*sumxy - sumx*sumy) / (size*squarex - sumx*sumx)
 val b = (sumy*squarex - sumx*sumxy) / (size*squarex - sumx*sumx)
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}
%  
%  // was it a good approximation?
%  assert(Math.abs(m - slope) < 0.1)
%  assert(Math.abs(b - intercept) < 0.1)
% \end{lstlisting-nobreak}

If we run one version of the above benchmark with the plugin activated (|Miniboxed|) and one without (|Generic|), for different amount of points, we get the following results:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 Amount of points & |Generic| [cs] & |Miniboxed| [cs] \\ 
 \hline
 30,000 & 12.552 & 13.252 \\
 60,000 & 27.253 & 29.128 \\
 90,000 & 42.782 & 43.947 \\
 120,000 & 60.575 & 64.846 \\
 150,000 & 74.202 & 82.995 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The results show that the erasure version runs $\sim$10\% faster. This is due to some issues causing boxing and unboxing to occur, and thus slowing down the execution. We are currently debugging on this; once solved, we would definitely have better numbers.
