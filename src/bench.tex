\section{Benchmarks}

In order to prove the efficienty of the miniboxing plugin, we wrote a benchmark about a common numerical application: the \textit{least squares method}. This method finds the best-fitting curve to a given set of points by minimizing the sum of the squares of the offsets of the points from the curve. The benchmark used is the following:

\begin{lstlisting-nobreak}
 // returns a random value between (-1,1)
 val random = new scala.util.Random(0)
 def rand = random.nextDouble - random.nextDouble
 
 val slope = 3.0  // arbitrary
 val intercept = 1.0  // arbitrary
 // func(x) = 3x + 1
 val func = new Function1[Int, Double] {
   def apply(x: Int): Double =
      slope*x + intercept
 }
 
 val size = 10000 // amount of points
 var xs: List[Double] = Nil // list of x-coord.
 var ys: List[Double] = Nil // list of y-coord.
 var i = 0
 
 // fills xs/ys with function + noise
 while (i < size) {
  xs = (i + rand) :: xs
  ys = (func(i) + rand) :: ys
  i += 1
 }
 
 val xy = xs.zip(ys) // list of (x,y) coord.
 
  // function (x, y) => x * y
 val fxy =
  new Function1[Tuple2[Double,Double], Double] {
     def apply(t: Tuple2[Double, Double]): Double = t._1 * t._2
 }
 val sumxy = listxy.map(fxy).sum
 
 // function x => x * x
 val fxx = new Function1[Double, Double] {
   def apply(x: Double): Double = x * x
 }
 val squarex = listx.map(fxx).sum
 
 // slope and intercept approximations
 val m = (size*sumxy - sumx*sumy) / (size*squarex - sumx*sumx)
 val b = (sumy*squarex - sumx*sumxy) / (size*squarex - sumx*sumx)
 
 // was it a good approximation?
 assert(|m - slope| < 0.1)
 assert(|b - intercept| < 0.1)
\end{lstlisting-nobreak}

For now, the results for an erasure-based type parameter (|Generic|) and the miniboxed version of them (|Miniboxed|) are the following :

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| } 
 \hline
 Amount of points & |Generic| [cs] & |Miniboxed| [cs] \\ 
 \hline
 30,000 & 12.552 & 13.252 \\
 60,000 & 27.253 & 29.128 \\
 90,000 & 42.782 & 43.947 \\
120,000 & 60.575 & 64.846 \\
 150,000 & 74.202 & 82.995 \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The results are not very convincing, they show that the erasure version runs $\sim$10\% faster. This was due to some issues causing boxing and unboxing to occur, and thus slowing down the execution. We are currently debugging on this; once solved, we would definitely have to better numbers.
